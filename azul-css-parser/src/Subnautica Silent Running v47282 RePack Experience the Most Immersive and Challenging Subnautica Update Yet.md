Subnautica is not just a game about exploring and surviving, but also about learning and discovering. There are many secrets and mysteries hidden in the ocean, and you will need to use your scanner, your PDA, and your curiosity to uncover them. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your Subnautica experience.
 
## Scan Everything
 
One of the most important tools in Subnautica is your scanner. You can use it to scan almost anything in the game, from flora and fauna to wrecks and alien structures. Scanning will give you valuable information about the environment, the creatures, and the resources. It will also unlock new blueprints for crafting items and building modules.
 
Some items require you to scan multiple fragments before you can access their blueprints. You can find these fragments scattered around the ocean floor, especially near wrecks and debris fields. Make sure to scan every fragment you see, as they might unlock something useful or essential for your progress.

Scanning is not only for unlocking blueprints, but also for learning more about the story and lore of Subnautica. You can scan alien tablets, data terminals, precursor caches, and other artifacts to reveal clues about the history and purpose of the planet you are on. You can also scan furniture and building pieces to give you the ability to craft them in your own base.
 
## Manage Your Inventory
 
Inventory space is limited in Subnautica, so you need to be smart about what you carry with you. You don't want to run out of room when you find something valuable or interesting. You also don't want to waste time and energy going back and forth between your base and your exploration site.
 
One way to manage your inventory is to use containers. You can craft lockers, wall lockers, waterproof lockers, and storage modules to store your items. You can place them in your base, in your vehicles, or even outside in the water. You can also label them with names or colors to help you organize your stuff.
 
Another way to manage your inventory is to use fabricators. You can craft fabricators for your base or for your vehicles. Fabricators allow you to turn raw materials into useful items, such as tools, equipment, food, water, batteries, and more. Fabricators also allow you to recycle items that you don't need anymore into their basic components.
 
A third way to manage your inventory is to use beacons. Beacons are small devices that emit a signal that you can see on your HUD. You can use beacons to mark locations of interest, such as resource deposits, wrecks, caves, biomes, or bases. You can also name and color-code your beacons to help you remember what they are for.
 
## Upgrade Your Equipment
 
As you explore deeper and more dangerous areas of the ocean, you will need better equipment to survive and thrive. You can upgrade your equipment by using modification stations, vehicle upgrade consoles, moonpool consoles, or cyclops consoles. These stations allow you to craft upgrades for your tools, suits, vehicles, and weapons.
 
Some of the upgrades that you can craft include: oxygen tanks that increase your diving time; fins that increase your swimming speed; suits that protect you from extreme temperatures or radiation; scanners that reveal nearby resources or creatures; flashlights that illuminate dark areas; knives that deal more damage or harvest resources; propulsion cannons that move objects or creatures; repair tools that fix damaged items or structures; habitat builders that allow you to construct bases; seaglides that boost your mobility; seamoths that let you travel faster and deeper; prawn suits that let you mine resources and fight enemies; cyclopses that let you carry more items and vehicles; torpedoes that let you attack from a distance; sonars that let you see through walls or water; shields that let you deflect attacks; decoys that let you distract predators; fire suppression systems that let you extinguish fires; solar panels that let you generate power from sunlight; bioreactors that let you generate power from organic matter; nuclear reactors that let you generate power from uranium rods; thermal plants that let you generate power from heat sources; power transmitters that let you transfer power between bases; water filtration machines that let you produce fresh water and salt; alien containment units that let you breed fish; observatories that let you view the outside environment; scanner rooms that let you scan for specific items or
