The movie follows Nicky Spurgeon (Smith), a veteran con man who takes Jess Barrett (Robbie), an aspiring grifter, under his wing. They become romantically involved, but Nicky breaks up with her after a successful heist in New Orleans. Three years later, they meet again in Buenos Aires, where Nicky is working for a wealthy race car owner named Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro). Jess is now Garriga's girlfriend, and she throws Nicky's plans for a loop. Nicky has to deal with his feelings for Jess, his rivalry with Garriga, and his own deception.
 
Focus received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the chemistry between Smith and Robbie, but criticized the plot for being implausible and predictable. The movie was a moderate box office success, grossing $159 million worldwide against a budget of $50 million.

Focus is not only a movie about con games, but also a movie full of trivia and behind-the-scenes stories. For example, did you know that Margot Robbie got the role of Jess after impressing Will Smith with her witty reply when he arrived late for the audition? She said "Yeah? Well, I just came from an island off Croatia and I'm here on time." Robbie was vacationing with her brother when she got the call to audition, and she had to travel for hours and deal with lost luggage to get there.
 
Another interesting fact is that Focus had a lot of casting changes before Smith and Robbie were confirmed. The movie was originally scheduled to star Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, but both dropped out. Then Ben Affleck and Kristen Stewart took on the leading roles, but Affleck dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. When Smith signed on, Stewart dropped out as well. It was rumored that it was due to the age difference between her and Smith, but Robbie and Stewart were born on the same year.
 
Focus also features some real-life con artists and experts who helped the filmmakers create authentic scenes of deception and manipulation. For example, Apollo Robbins, a renowned pickpocket and sleight-of-hand artist, was hired as a consultant and a trainer for the actors. He also appears in the movie as one of Nicky's crew members. Another consultant was David Kwong, a magician and crossword puzzle constructor, who helped design some of the puzzles and codes used in the movie.
