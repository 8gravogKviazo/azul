One of the advantages of EzGrabber2 is that it has a built-in hardware encoder that compresses the video in real time. This reduces the CPU usage and ensures a smooth and high-quality video capture. You can also adjust the bitrate, resolution, frame rate and other parameters to suit your needs. EzGrabber2 supports both NTSC and PAL video standards.
 
EzGrabber2 is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10 operating systems. You can also use it on Linux with some third-party software such as VLC or OBS. However, you will need to install the driver manually on Linux.
