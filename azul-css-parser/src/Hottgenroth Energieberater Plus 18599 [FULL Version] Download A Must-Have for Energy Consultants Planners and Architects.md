You can choose from a wide range of options, such as boilers, heat pumps, solar panels, heat recovery units, LED lamps and more. You can also enter your own parameters for custom systems. The software will automatically calculate the energy demand and consumption of the building and its systems.
  
The final step is to generate the output documents and reports for your project, such as energy certificates, individual renovation plans (iSFP), KfW calculations and more.
