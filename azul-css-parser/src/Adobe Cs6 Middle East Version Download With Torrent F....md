To access the MENA editions of InDesign or Illustrator, you need to change the language of your Creative Cloud desktop app to either Hebrew or Arabic for a short time. This will allow you to download and install the software you want. After that, you can switch back to your preferred language. To change the language of your Creative Cloud desktop app, follow these steps:
