## Method 1: Change Language on Steam
 
If you bought Fallout New Vegas on Steam, you can easily change the language of the game by following these steps:
 
1. Right click on Fallout New Vegas in your Steam library and select Properties.
2. Select Language from the menu on the left.
3. Select English from the drop-down list and click OK.
4. Wait for Steam to download the language file and launch the game.

This method should work for most players who have access to multiple languages on Steam[^2^]. However, some players may have a mono-language edition of the game, such as German-only or Russian-only[^4^]. In that case, they will need to use another method.
 
## Method 2: Download Language Pack from Nexus Mods
 
Nexus Mods is a website that hosts thousands of mods for various games, including Fallout New Vegas. Some of these mods are language packs that can change the audio and text of the game to different languages. To install Fallout New Vegas English Language Pack from Nexus Mods, you will need to do the following:

1. Create an account on Nexus Mods and download their mod manager called Vortex.
2. Go to this link: https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/70458 and click on Manual Download to download Fallout New Vegas - American Pack (English) mod[^1^]. This mod adds unique weapons, apparel and aid items that are themed around America, as well as changing the language to English.
3. Open Vortex and drag and drop the downloaded file into the Mods section.
4. Click on Install and then Enable the mod.
5. Launch Fallout New Vegas from Vortex and enjoy the game in English.

This method should work for players who want to add some extra content to their game along with changing the language. However, some players may prefer a more vanilla experience and only want to change the language without adding any other mods. In that case, they will need to use another method.

If none of the above methods work for you, you can try changing your region and language settings on Windows. This may allow you to download and install the language pack for Fallout New Vegas from Microsoft Store. To do this, you will need to follow these steps:
